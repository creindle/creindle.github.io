## Overview

_The Problem_ : All the Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) machines are gone! And college students love to play DDR!

_The Solution_ : Create a mobile version of the popular DDR game! Using Meteor!!

To use this application, students must use their UH login to access the game that will keep track of their scores. There will be leaderboards to boost the students self-esteem. They may be terrible in the classroom, but they're awesome at dancing (finger-dancing)! There are many facets of a student and this shows one of them. Having many students on this application will create a fun, competetive environment, just like how the arcades used to be!

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
* Title Page
* Login Page
* Leaderboard Page
* Stats Page
* Selection of Music Page
* Game Window Page

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
* New user goes to title page, login page, selection of music page, game window page
* Player goes to title page, stats page, leaderboard page

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Text message interface to send notification of who beat your score
* Rating system
* Different difficulties

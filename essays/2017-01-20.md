<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/matrix.jpg">*The Beauty of Javascript*

## If I had prior experience, how did I learn new things?

When I see code I have not worked with before, I start working on a project, or, implement the new code into a current project. Then, I tie it into my passions, as I see no point in learning something if you have no passion for it.

For many projects, I love to tackle the difficult portions, the portions that leave many wondering "How do we even do this"? The reason why I love tackling these difficult portions is because I know Javascript has already figured out the solution to the problem. Javascipt is extremely versatile.

## Example

Recently, my company brought some hardware down to us. The hardware they brought were a Bare Conductive Touch Board, which contains an Arduino Heart and some Raspberry Pis. I had no clue how to work with these items, but I know Javascript! So! I was able to work with these items through Javascript! Isn't that amazing? :D

## Do I think Javascript is a good programming language?

Absolutely! I came into Javascript from a very weak programming background. I was just not passionate because I thought I was not intelligent at all. Many of my peers around me not only understood the code, but they *liked* the code, while I would spend my time dreading the next assignment.


## What about from a software engineering perspective?

After I entered DevLeague, a full stack development bootcamp, I learned just how versatile Javascript could be! I also learn that many, many people struggle with code... as it's another language! Because of this experience, I now develop many, many web and software applications for children and I *enjoy* what I do. I look forward to creating the next application.

## What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

Yes to all of this! This is absolutely useful because many companies **test** you like how we're tested in class! **And** it's all written on the whiteboard, rather than on an editor! I've practiced WODs before through the site [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) because I was so terrified of jumping into projects. It was very stressful in the beginning, but then I began to enjoy it. It works very well for me.

## Why are smart questions important for smart software engineers

Smart questions are important for smart software engineers because, depending on the level of difficult, the answer to these smart questions would help others immensely.

## How the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions

The way the [chosen questions](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/58577/how-to-connect-a-headless-raspberry-pi-3-to-a-mac) fulfill the precepts for smart questions are from showing previous knowledge and being clear and concise. The user showed he/she attempted to solve the problem on their own as they are very knowledgeable in what worked and didn't work to their solution and even gave a partial answer to their own question!

## How the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof)

The way the responses demonstrated the smartness is shown from the size of the responses, the amount of detail in the response, and the amount of "upvotes" for the response.

## The insights you gained as a result of this experience

The insights I've gained as a result of this experience are the mind of the developer, what an supervisor in tech would want to hear, and how I've done in my life, as a person in tech, when receiving and/or creating problems. I realized it is through our questions that show our intelligence.

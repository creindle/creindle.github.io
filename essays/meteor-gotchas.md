## One Meteor Problem That You Had That You've Fixed
The first issue that I had with manipulating the photo in the header of the application was due to my lack of fine detail in the overall application.

I initially placed the image of the file in a different directory, rather than the one in the tutorial. This displayed my image below the header and created a subsection next to the title page. 

## One Meteor Problem That You Still Need To Fix
The problem that still bothers me to this day was one,

## One Meteor Problem that You Had That You've Fixed
It is almost hitting midnight, the team is on their last stretch before the project is due. Everyone is jamming as quickly as they can overlooking all the bugs in the program. It is the last week of a month long hackathon and the MVP of the application is barely getting reached as each developer is slowly losing steam. Everyone is pushing their code up to GitHub, the changes are overlapping each other, but there is just one thing missing. The team moves to their last stretch and it was up to me to integrate the main functionality of our entire application. The question was asked...<br>
**Functionality** or **Design**? What do you want to do next, Christie? <br>
"I HATE CSS, I totally don't want to design the page! I choose functionality!"<br>

## One Meteor Problem That You Still Need To Fix
At that moment, my team was participating in the first Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge and we were exhaused. Our application reached the minimum viable product by being fully functional, but our team lost in its entirety due to the lack of design. We blamed our loss to not having a designer, but I was given the choice of using an UI Framework. As I saw the other team in our company work with just raw HTML and CSS, I initially felt that I would cheat myself if I used a UI framework instead. Because of this, I postponed integrating the design into our application as I thought it would be easy since it wasn't raw HTML and CSS. This was absolutely not the case and I was not even able to startup the base template. I was so frustrated because I underestimated the power of UI frameworks.

## On That Note
By the way, the team that won the competition used Ionic, a HTML5 mobile app development framework. From their site: <br>
"Think of Ionic as the front-end UI framework". <br>
I still wonder where we would've placed, if we chose to work on design rather than not.

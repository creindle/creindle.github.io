summary: An educational game where students can practice basic coding vocabulary
---

The project was our entry to the annual Node Knockout, a 48 hour hackathon featuring Node.js. It is an online, virtual competition with contestants worldwide. We wanted to create a variation of the popular game "Hangman", but we wanted to create a game that was not as morbid.

My role in the development of the game was implenting the event handlers for user input, ensuring the hidden words were populated from a database of words, and game playability. I was responsible for making the skeleton of the game, particularly the Javascript portion.

I learned how quickly I am able to create a project, how I act under pressure, that I am able to come up with working code quickly, and the limits of myself.

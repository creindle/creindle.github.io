Manoa Quest is a collaboration between 3 die-hard fans of the Final Fantasy series (specifically IX) who are not only hardcore gamers, but also, experienced developers. 

<h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
Evan, Kirk, and I all come from various backgrounds of software development. I graduated from a software development bootcamp, Evan is a stellar student who already worked in the field, while Kirk was in the military and specifically worked with databases. I did not know of my teammates backgrounds before starting this project, so I was pleasantly surprised when I started to work with them. Initally, I didn't want my teammates to feel overwhelmed and I knew from past experiences that it is easy to plan unreachable goals, so I set a low standard and secretly planned on completing the assignment myself to help my teammates have a fantastic project on their resume. I was then blown away when I saw every single site we mocked up immediately completed within a week! WITH STYLES! I knew I had to get to know my teammates more and I needed an excuse to party, so I planned a get together at my FAVORITE Korean restaurant on Oahu [Millions](https://www.yelp.com/biz/million-restaurant-honolulu)! Only then did I find out exactly who I was working with and knew we could make a much more complex and innovative project. I knew, within the next week, we could have our entire front and backend completed.

<h1>But Do You REALLY Know Meteor??</h1>
As this final project was a compliation of what we learned from the class, I knew I would have some trouble with this project. Although I was always one of the first people to complete the in-class challenges, those mini challenges are microscopic in comparison to a full-stack project. LUCKILY, my teammates were geniuses with a drive to overachieve and I wasn't stressed out at all! I simply asked my teammates how to implement a feature of our project and they either knew how to do this or knew what resource I could use! Also, we had to implement CAS, which is a login system to our schools credentials. I had an idea of what we could use as I worked with the in-memory data structure store Redis, but I knew that this would be an overkill for what we had to do and my teammate confirmed this by pointing to a project already implemented by our instructor and Information and Computer Science faculty [Bowfolios](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios). After looking at this site, I was able to successfully implement a
